# Deveo Android App

A personal project of mine that started off as a school project. Please note that it's still a work in progress.

In the future, when I feel like it's somewhat presentable, I'm planning on moving it under the Deveo organization, thus the license.

## Building

The project uses [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) for its builds and requires Android SDK to be installed in your development environment.

You can either `gradle build` to simply build the project or `gradle clean build` to build the project from scratch.

_Note: I'm using Java 7._

## Acknowledgements

The project uses a few open source libraries, such as [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) for contacting the Deveo APIs and [ImageLoader](https://github.com/novoda/ImageLoader) for asynchronous image loading. See [build.gradle](https://github.com/vluoto/deveo-android/blob/master/android/build.gradle) for full list of dependencies.
